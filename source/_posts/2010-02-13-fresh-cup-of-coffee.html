<p>JavaScript: The platform of the future? With <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> on the hotspot everyone is looking back to using JavaScript as server-side language. And while Node.js is pretty awesome, I really donâ€™t think c-like languages are expressive. <a href="http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script">CoffeeScript</a> is a Ruby inspired language that compiles to JavaScript. It has great syntax and cool features like interactive mode. Definately project to watch.</p>&#13;
