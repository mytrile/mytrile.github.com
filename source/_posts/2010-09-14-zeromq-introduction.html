<h3>Intro</h3>&#13;
<p>Last week I was looking at <a title="ZeroMQ" target="_blank" href="http://www.zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> mostly because of <a title="Mogrel2" target="_blank" href="http://mongrel2.org">Mongrel2</a>. Reading the documentation, turoials and examples I decided to write series about ZeroMQ only because I want to clear out some things for me. I always said that I write crappy blog posts, because I want to remember stuff I've used/found interesting. Another reason is that I have to dig in the object of the post. The series will include different things about ZeroMQ: transport, infrastructural and messaging pattern choices. But before we start ...</p>&#13;
<h3>A few things about the series:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>I'm not professional programmer</li>&#13;
<li>I really like UNIX stuff, but I haven't had time to dig in</li>&#13;
<li>I'll be using Ruby for the examples, because I'm familiar with it and the code can be read and understood by anyone (hopefully)</li>&#13;
<li>This series are shallow and I want to show the basic usage of ZeroMQ</li>&#13;
<li>Any suggestions are welcomed :)</li>&#13;
</ul><h3>So here we go</h3>&#13;
<p>When I try to write some network application code, I have to choose between low-level API ( <a title="Berkeley Sockets" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">Berkeley Sockets</a> ) or some kind of high-level messaging protocol like <a title="AMQP" target="_blank" href="http://www.amqp.org/confluence/display/AMQP/Advanced+Message+Queuing+Protocol">AMQP</a>(and implementation of that protocol like <a title="RabbitMQ" target="_blank" href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ </a>messaging system). Being low-level sockets are hard to use and there is a lot of stuff I have to handle by myself(buffering, error handling, etc.). On the other hand AMQP gives me great power, but I lose some scalability and flexibility. And in the middle is ZeroMQ.</p>&#13;
<p>The best explanation of ZeroMQ I found comes from <a title="Zed Shaw" target="_blank" href="http://sheddingbikes.com/">Zed Shaw</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><span>What ZeroMQ ends up being is "sockets the way programmers think sockets work". </span></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>ZeroMQ is minimalistic, powerful, scalable, fast and transport agnostic networking library which gives me the ease of using "human-face" sockets. There are bindings for <span>20+ languages including C, C++, Java, .NET, Ruby, Python</span> etc. It's transport agnosticism enables me to use <a title="ZeroMQ TCP API" target="_blank" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_tcp.html">TCP</a>, <a title="ZeroMQ IPC API" target="_blank" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_ipc.html">IPC</a>, <a title="ZeroMQ INPROC API" target="_blank" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_inproc.html">INPROC</a> and <a title="ZeroMQ PGM API" target="_blank" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_pgm.html">PGM</a> very easy. Being message-oriented ZeroMQ handles all the work for me (like load balancing messages) and leaves to me the choice of message pattern (<a title="REQUEST/REPLY pattern" target="_blank" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_socket.html#_request_reply_pattern">REQUEST/REPLY</a>, <a title="PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE pattern" target="_blank" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_socket.html#_publish_subscribe_pattern">PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE</a>, <a title="Pipeline pattern" target="_blank" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_socket.html#_pipeline_pattern">Pipeline</a>, <a title="PAIR pattern" target="_blank" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_socket.html#_exclusive_pair_pattern">PAIR</a>).</p>&#13;
<h3>The series</h3>&#13;
<p>I know there are a l1ot of buzzwords, but I'll try to explain them in the series:</p>&#13;
<ul><li><a title="ZeroMQ: Messaging patterns" target="_self" href="http://fireinside.me/post/3551747763/zeromq-messaging-patterns">Infrastructure and messaging patterns</a></li>&#13;
<li>Basic chat application</li>&#13;
<li>Bindings and libraries using ZeroMQ</li>&#13;
<li>Real world apps</li>&#13;
<li>Links to guides, tutorials and articles</li>&#13;
</ul><h3>Installing ZeroMQ and zmq gem</h3>&#13;
<p>The instructions how to get and compile ZeroMQ are on <a title="ZeroMQ Download" target="_blank" href="http://www.zeromq.com/page:get-the-software">their web site</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>In the examples I'm using zmq gem:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>[sudo] gem install zmq</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
