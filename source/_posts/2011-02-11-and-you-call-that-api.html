<p>Hey folks at edno23, are you retarded ? I bet you are.</p>
<p>First of all you provided unofficial API for your crappy twitter-clone which was basically modified feed. Second you said that you won't support extensive API, because you want your users to use the website instead of applications. Yeah, you are retarded.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw that these fuckheads realsed official APIs.Â </p>
<p>1. Why the hell you wrote it in english when your audiance is only bulgarians. You even don't have english version of the crappy site.</p>
<p>2. Why you copied twitter documentation claiming yours is compatible !?!</p>
<p>3. Do you know what content-type is ?</p>

<p>You want JSON ? No problem, mate. Here is your HTML.</p>
