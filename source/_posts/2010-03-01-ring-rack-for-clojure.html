<p>If you're looking for something similar to Ruby's Rack or Python's <span class="caps">WSGI</span>, but for Clojure, take a look at <a href="http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring">Ring</a>. The simple unified <span class="caps">API</span> allows easily constructing web applications with modular architecture. At this moment two adapaters are supported: Jetty and Apache HttpCore webserver.</p>&#13;
