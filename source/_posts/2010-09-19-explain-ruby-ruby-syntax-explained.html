<blockquote>&#13;
<p><span>Paste Ruby code or a URL to get Ruby syntax explained.</span></p>&#13;
<p><span><em>Explain Ruby</em> will not be able to explain what the code in question <em>does</em>, i.e. the original author's intent, but it will help newcomers to Ruby to learn how to read code by teaching them programming constructs of the Ruby programming language.</span></p>&#13;
