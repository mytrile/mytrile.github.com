<p>Rails is awesome, but what makes it great is Ruby. I found myself  learning Rails without knowing Ruby. Don't make my mistake. Some books:<br /><br />"The Ruby Programming Language" from O'Reilly<br />"The Ruby Way" and "Design Patterns in Ruby" from Addison-Wesley<br />"Ruby for Rails" from Manning</p>
