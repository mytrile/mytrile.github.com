    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I've read <a title="Lift" target="_blank" href="http://seventhings.liftweb.net/index">an article</a> about 7 reasons why "Lift is the most powerful, most secure web framework available today". One of the reasons got my attention - <a title="Designer friendly templates" target="_blank" href="http://seventhings.liftweb.net/templates">Designer Friendly Templates</a>. First thing in my mind was - What does "designer friendly template" has to do with security and power of web framework ? The second thought was after reading the argument for the previous statement:</p>


<p>&#13;</p>

<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The designers do not have to learn any tag libraries or any other language.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>


<p>&#13;</p>

<p>Ok, so it's easy to learn css class names rather then take 15 minutes to learn template engine like haml or mustache ? Really ? </p>


<p>&#13;</p>

<p>I've looked over Scala/Lift and I think it's pretty neat combination, but these guys need to learn how to promote their product. Every time I read/hear something from Lifts camp it's always the same : "Secure, powerfull" and still I don't really understand why it's better than Django/Rails for example.</p>
